# Gravitational Few-Body Dynamics
Numerical simulations and chapter-wise implementation inspired by *Gravitational Few Body Dynamics: A Numerical Approach* by Seppo Mikkola.

## Authors
- Aayusha Singh (NIT Srinagar)
- Amrit Roy (NIT Srinagar)

## Goals
- Understand and simulate the dynamics of few-body gravitational systems
- Implement symplectic and regularized integrators
- Explore chaotic motion, stability, and long-term orbital behavior
- Apply learned methods to real astrophysical systems

## Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for chapter-wise understanding
- `src/`: Core Python functions for integrators and orbital mechanics
- `plots/`: Visual outputs from simulations
- `papers/`: Summaries, questions, and ideas for future research

## Getting Started
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
